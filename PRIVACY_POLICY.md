# Privacy Policy for Dash Platform Extension

**Last Updated: [Date]**

Thank you for using the Dash Platform Extension ("the Extension"). This Privacy Policy is intended to inform you about how we handle your data. Your privacy and security are of utmost importance to us.

## 1. No Collection of Personal Data

We do not collect, store, or transmit any of your personally identifiable information (PII). Personally identifiable information includes, but is not limited to, your name, email address, physical address, or phone number. The Extension is designed to work without needing any personal data from you.

## 2. Data Stored Locally

All data required for the Extension to function is stored locally on your device within your browser's storage. This includes:

- Your wallet information and encrypted keys.
- Your identity data.
- Your transaction history.
- Application connection settings.

This data is stored securely on your computer and is never transmitted to our servers. You have full control over this data and can clear it at any time by clearing your browser's storage or by uninstalling the Extension.

## 3. Third-Party Services

The Extension interacts with the Dash Platform network to function. Specifically, to retrieve your transaction history and other blockchain-related data, the Extension makes requests to public Dash Platform APIs (such as a block explorer). These requests may include your public identity ID, which is necessary to query your on-chain data.

These API providers have their own privacy policies, and we encourage you to review them. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of these third-party services.

## 4. Permissions

The Extension requires the following permissions in your browser to function correctly:

- **Storage:** To store your wallet data, identities, and other settings locally on your device.
- **ActiveTab:** To interact with web pages and facilitate communication between your wallet and decentralized applications (dApps).

We only request permissions that are essential for the Extension's functionality.

## 5. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.
